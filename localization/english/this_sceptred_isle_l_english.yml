 tsi_events.2.d:0 "Bryten is prosperous, yet alone."
 tsi_events.2.f:0 "Triumphant crusades to the Holy Land, grueling Northern Wars with Sweden, and eventually the Great European War in the 16th century - Bryten has shaped the history of Europe like no other. Once the greatest land power in Europe, Bryten was pushed out of the continent and turned to the seas instead, crafting a vast colonial empire.\n\nIn the Blæghtcrieg, Bryten broke its alliance with the Occitans and stayed out, allowing the Richters to establish their hegemony. The future will tell whether this was a mistake or stroke of genius. Now, the Entente is rebuilt, and Bryten partitions Europe, then the world, with the Kaiser in Cork. Some enmities have been settled, others only grew - a new era is beginning."
 
 tsi_events.3.t:0 "The Fragmented Occident"
 tsi_events.3.d:0 "The legacy of the Richters lingers."
 tsi_events.3.f:0 "Europe is defined by two revolutions - Hellenic and German. The Hellenes overthrew their emperors and established the world's first modern democracy, defeating armies of all of Europe with their determination, while Karl Richter, the great conqueror born a lowborn, became the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and carved out a hegemony. Today, allies and enemies are made on the question of whether you are pro or anti-German.\n\nEurope stretches across the globe with colonizers such as Bryten, Iberia and the United Kingdom, while in the East, the great Slavic tsardoms slowly modernize. Bohemia-Poland, once a great power in its own right, has been utterly dismantled, while smaller powers such as Sweden, Batavia, Lithuania and Hungary search for their place in the world."
 
 tsi_events.4.t:0 "The Heart of the World"
 tsi_events.4.d:0 "Asia remains the land of riches and emperors."
 tsi_events.4.f:0 "Great rulers with hundreds of millions of subjects divide the largest continent in the globe - the Xu Dynasty, established by warlike musket-wielding Tibetans, and the Alshaebian Caliphate, the successors to the great Suri Empire, who declare themselves the leaders of all Islam. To this day, they resisted the Europeans, limiting them to small outposts and colonies.\n\nThe largest of them are the Osbaldines, a trading company that only nominally follows Brytisk command. Korea and Dai Viet, modernizing kingdoms backed by European merchants, have carved vast lands out of the weakening Xu, while Japan has only recently finished its civil war between traditionalists and Western-backed Kirishitan daimyos."
 
 tsi_events.5.t:0 "The Age of Fylkirs"
 tsi_events.5.d:0 "The great questions of Avalon are solved with muskets."
 tsi_events.5.f:0 "Discovered by the Brytisk in the 1400s, Avalon is now packed with small folkstats, each one battling for supremacy. Not long ago the east of the continent witnessed the Avalonian Wars against Palachia, who sought to unite all of Brytisk Avalon under one Commonwealþ. Democracy fades, replaced with the rule of military commanders - Fylkirs.\n\nThe regional giant is the Empire of Gylleon, ruled by a fusion of Swedish and Aztec nobility and slowly colonising the North. In Mizibi, Antillia and the slavocratic folkstat of Kuba, the horrors of slavery remain, fueling a profitable cash crop economy. Far in the west, small Korean outposts are lodged, bringing wood and fish back home."
 
 tsi_events.6.t:0 "Eden in the New World"
 tsi_events.6.d:0 "Free of European rule, the New World grows."
 tsi_events.6.f:0 "Named after Irish myth, the continent of Brasil is now independent of its former European masters, and is divided between fledgling republics. Two titans divide much of the continent: in the west, the Inca Empire rebuilds after long epidemics and wars with the Batavians, intent to defend the freedom of its skræling peoples, while in the east, the United Provinces of Mesopotamia attract thousands of immigrants from the West while steadily expanding its power. Deep questions over slavery and its Louisian minority may soon crash this prosperity down, however.\n\nIn the north of the continent, Batavian and Swedish colonies stay away from conflicts north and south, while Islam from Bindudetama spreads like wildfire among their slave populations."
 
 tsi_events.7.t:0 "The Cradle of Humanity"
 tsi_events.7.d:0 "Africa is divided between great powers and threatened peoples."
 tsi_events.7.f:0 "Mostly forgotten by the European powers, Africa is home to several great powers, but most of the continent is under threat by aspiring colonists. Keme, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, was established by Ænglisk crusaders and its dynasty intertwined with the native Copts, creating a Christian power in the Middle East. Morocco was among the explorers of the New World, but its power has long since waned, and it seems content to keep to its own in future wars.\n\nForged in Kaarta's anti-slavery jihad, the Mali Empire dominates West Africa and has stamped out slave trade in the region, and while it seeks to modernize, its efforts may be already too late. European outposts stand across the southern coast, intent to establish their presence deeper."
 
 tsi_events.8.t:0 "The Polish War"
 tsi_events.8.d:0 "In the East, the first great war of the 19th century begins."
 tsi_events.8.f:0 "In Cork, Ireland, Executor Morgan Blood and Kaiser Frederick Richter began settling their accounts, first by redrawing the map of Europe. According to their agreement, Bohemia and Poland were to be reunited into Wendlund, which existed prior to the Blæghtcrieg and was a great power - now, it would be in the German sphere, yet neutral and independent.\n\nThe news were received with applause in Wendlund, and the King of Poland was declared the King of Wendlund. His uncle in Kiev did not accept this, however - and the Ruthenians now march to war, intent to carve out a separate Poland and put an end to Wendish dreams of unity. The first large scale war of the 19th century is about to begin."

The League of Kigama, a confederation of several skræling tribes, joined Palachia in the Avalonian Wars and was awarded the northern part of the Kigama Peninsula as a result.\n\nThe Fourth Avalonian War led to Palachia's defeat and Jervis' death, and the skræling republic was annexed by Onteryo. Almost unanimously, the Folksmoot voted to move the Iroquois, as well as other skrælings of the Kigama Peninsula, westward to prevent any rebellions and vacate their land for white settlers."

Over time, two tsardoms consolidated in the former Kievan Rus' and expanded eastwards - Kiev and Volga, in the south and in the north. Yet, over time, their peoples slowly grew closer to one another again, motivated by an age of nationalism and defeats against the Westerners that forced them to unite.\n\nNow, with blood and diplomacy alike, this unification has been accomplished once more.

Yet, during the Revolutions of Bravalon, this dream collapsed, broken by the rise of independent Palachia, Sverria and Onteryo. Today, this historical mistake has finally been amended, and a united Avalon rises forth.\n\nOur people are eager to reclaim their lost place in the sun, and the potential of a unified Avalon is enormous. The West still has to be conquered, and the rest of the world enlightened with Folkist ideals."
